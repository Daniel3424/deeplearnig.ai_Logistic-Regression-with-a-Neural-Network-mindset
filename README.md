Starting September 2020, notebook items in course shells will become Ungraded Labs. Paid learners will be able to access their notebooks in the new Coursera lab environment; Auditors will lose access. We strongly encourage you to download your notebooks if you are auditing this course. You can also upgrade or applying for financial aid to access premium Lab items in your course. For more information, please see this forum link

Welcome to the first (required) programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. In this notebook you will build your first image recognition algorithm. You will build a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy!

As you keep learning new techniques you will increase it to 80+ % accuracy on cat vs. non-cat datasets. By completing this assignment you will:

- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.

- Learn how to minimize the cost function.

- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.
